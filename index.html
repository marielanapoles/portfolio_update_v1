          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>During that time in highschool, I was fond in the process of creating and drawing beautiful infrastructure so I decided, why not become an Architect? Unfortunately because of some reasons, I wasn't able to pursue that career.</p>
          <p>Long story gone short, I ended up gaining CCNA Certificates from my previous university. I like working with the CLI in packet tracer without realizing my love for coding. When I was in the middle of designing my IT Capstone, and doing some research, web development just hit me hard and Ive realized that I could create and build beautiful things for people in this field, just like when I was in high school.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>Since web development is just a part of the greater part of the technology, instead of mastering a certain programming or scripting languages, I wanted to learn and experience working with other branches of the technolgy and then try another, and then Ill jump off to another. I wanted to work to have experience in working at the following fields: </p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>System Analysis &amp; Design</li>
            <li>UX/UI Design</li>
            <li>Virtual Reality</li>
            <li>Database Management</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Now, I want to pursue Web Dev and be part of creating beautiful web experiences for the world. For my jump start, this is me now, trying to learn how to code on treehouse. Way to go!</p>
