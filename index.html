          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>During that time in highschool, I was fond in the process of creating and drawing beautiful infrastructure so I decided, why not become an Architect? Unfortunately because of some reasons, I wasn't able to pursue that career.</p>
          <p>Long story gone short, I ended up gaining CCNA Certificates from my previous university. I like working with the CLI in packet tracer without realizing my love for coding. When I was in the middle of designing my IT Capstone, and doing some research, web development just hit me hard and Ive realized that I could create and build beautiful things for people in this field, just like when I was in high school. Now, I want to pursue Web Dev and be part of creating beautiful web experiences for the world.</p>
          <p>For my jump start, this is me now, trying to learn how to code on treehouse. Way to go!</p>
